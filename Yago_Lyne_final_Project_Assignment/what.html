                        <h1>WHAT IS BRONCHIAL ASTHMA ?</h1>
                        <p><strong>Bronchial asthma</strong> is a long-lasting respiratory issue marked by inflamed airways, causing frequent instances of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms It affects people of all ages and results from a mix of genetic and environmental factors<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653">(Mayo Clinic, 2022)</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma">World Health, in 2019, about 262 million individuals globally live with asthma </a>, making it a significant worldwide health concern.

                        Certain demographic factors can heighten the risk of developing bronchial asthma. This include individuals with a family history of asthma or other allergies . Children exposed to environmental pollutants, and individuals with a history of respiratory infections may be more prone to developing asthma as well<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653"> (2022)</a>.

                        Grasping the occurrence tied to bronchial asthma is vital for effective targeted healthcare measures. Ongoing research works towards a deeper understanding of the complexities of asthma, to improve prevention and treatment approaches. This page includes a breakdown of the different types of <strong>common Asthmas</strong> and an overview,<a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/asthma/learn-about-asthma/types">as per the American Lung Assocation (2022)</a>,of each ones.</p>

                                 <h2>1. Allergic Asthma:</h2>

                                 <p>This type of Asthma is triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollen, pet dander, mold spores, or certain foods. The triggers vary from an individual to another. The distinct symptoms of this type of Asthma may include wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath after exposure to triggering allergens.</p>

                                  <h2>2. Non-Allergic Asthma:</h2>
 
                                 <p>This type of Asthma gets its symptoms triggered by factors <strong>OTHER </strong>than allergens. Common triggers for this type include factors such as stress, cold air, exercise, respiratory infections and other similar triggers. It shares similar symptoms with allergic asthma but is not associated with an allergic response.</p>

                                  
                                  <h2>3. Occupational Asthma:</h2>
