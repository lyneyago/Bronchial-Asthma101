                                 <p>Hello everyone! My name is Lyne Yago, I am a student at the University of Toronto Mississauga in my final year of a bachelor in Biology for Health Sciences and minoring in Biomedical communication! I come from Burkina Faso a small landlocked west African country. The idea of this website comes from my personal experience as an individual non affected by Bronchial Asthma living in a high incidence community. I remember being younger and not knowing what bronchial asthma was nor how I could help those affected by the condition. I had to do my own research, ask my own questions to understand the challenges of the condition and how we, as the family, friends and neighbors of the patients, we could act to assist those who need it. This website is in some way a very simplified overview of Bronchial Asthma and how you can make yourself useful by 1)Being more knowledgeable 2)Learning the right behaviors! </p>
